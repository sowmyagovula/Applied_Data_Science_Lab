# Mexico House Prices Analysis and Predictions

## üåç Project Overview

This project is part of the **Data Science Lab** from *WorldQuant University* coursework. In this analysis, we explore a dataset containing **21,000 property listings** from Mexico, Open resource available on platform **kaggle.com**.

Our primary objective is to assess:

> **Are house sale prices in Mexico influenced more by property size or by location?**

Through this project, we practice exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning techniques to build predictive models and generate insights.

## üìä Dataset Description

* **Source**: Kaggle 
* **Data Points**: 21,000+ listings
* **Features Include**:

  * Property size (`surface_covered_in_m2`, `surface_total_in_m2`)
  * Price (`price_aprox_usd`)
  * Location (`lat`, `lon`, `place_with_parent_names`, `state`)
  * Property type

## ‚öñÔ∏è Objectives

* Clean and preprocess the dataset
* Understand the role of geographic location vs. size in price determination
* Visualize housing trends and distribution
* Build predictive models for price estimation

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Visualizations via Plotly Express & Matplotlib
* Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Decision Trees

---

## üèÜ Results Summary

* Property **location**, especially proximity to central Mexico City, is a significant predictor of price.
* Property **size** also affects price, but its influence varies greatly by location.
* Simple regression models achieved reasonable accuracy, but spatial features enhance predictions.
